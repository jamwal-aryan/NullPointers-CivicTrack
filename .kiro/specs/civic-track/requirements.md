# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CivicTrack is a citizen engagement platform that empowers local residents to report and track civic issues within their neighborhood. The system enables users to report various types of local problems (road damage, lighting issues, water leaks, cleanliness concerns, etc.) and track their resolution status. The platform includes location-based visibility restrictions, ensuring users only see and interact with issues within a 3-5 km radius of their location. The system supports both anonymous and verified reporting, includes administrative tools for managing flagged content, and provides analytics for civic authorities.
